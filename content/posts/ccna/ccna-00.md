## My Super Duper Plan

{{< image src="https://media.tenor.com/SwO6NZo4KacAAAAC/scheming-evil-plan.gif" caption="Evil Scheming" height=10%, width=40% >}}

1. Choose a study resource and stick to it.
   > Options:
   >
   >- [Jeremy's IT LAB video course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ)
   >- Everyone else
   >
2. Stay consistent and revise regularly 🤡.
3. Schedule the exam.
4. Pass the exam.

## My poison of choice

After extensive research (skimming through the most voted post on the CCNA subreddit[^1]) I have decided to go with the following resources:

- [Jeremy's IT LAB video course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ)
- [Lab's from our lord and saviour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgcGcrLKu1A&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMQ4HTuaJ7yQgA2BoNwY9ct)
- [Boson practice exams](https://www.boson.com/practice-exam/200-301-cisco-ccna-practice-exam)

## TLDR

1. For the optimist:
    > I **might** get my act together and finally start studying seriously.
2. For the realist:
    > Get bored, and add to the many lists of things I started but never finished.

In either case, you my dear reader get to be a part of it.
