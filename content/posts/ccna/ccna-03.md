- 7 Dwarves from Snow White

- 7 Deadly Sins

- 7 Continents

- 7 Rings of Power (*shush just pretend there are 7 rings of power in LOTR*)

- 7 Layers of OSI Model <-- This is what we are going to talk about today.

## Why?

Models are stupid, they never reflect reality and always oversimplify things.... but they are useful. They allow us to understand complex things by simplifying them.

It's like when in school they tell you that an atom is made of protons, neutrons and electrons. But in reality, an atom is made of quarks, leptons, bosons, etc. But they don't tell you that because it's too complicated. So they simplify it and tell you that an atom is made of protons, neutrons and electrons.

## What?

The OSI Model is a **conceptual model** that allows us to understand how data is sent and received between 2 devices.

## 7 Layers to rule them all?

## TLDR

Models are useless, but they are useful.

Just know the names of the layers and what they do.
