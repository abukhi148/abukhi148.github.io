## What am I doing with my existence?
The very original github profile readme style intro with the cute emojis:

        ðŸ’» Working as a Junior Engineer at a company that shall not be named.
        ðŸ“ˆ Mostly code in Python.
        ðŸŒ± Working towards my CCNA.

{{< center-quote >}}3 should be more than enough, not too much and not too little.{{< /center-quote >}}

## Hobbies

- **Gaming**: As kid I had the time but not the money to buy all the games, now I have all games but not the time.
- **Magic The Gathering**: parents do not let your kids play magic, it is by far the worst addiction ever.
- **Homelabbing**: for the uninitiated, it is the process of building out large, power-hungry enterprise class servers, storage and networking at home.
- **Hiking**: just to shatter any assumptions of that I might be a total shut in.
- **Anime/Manga**: shocking right?
